# Customer Tasks

If you are interested in AnyDesk send a request to [Gl端ck & Kanja \(GK\)](mailto:support@glueckkanja.com). GK sends you two different URLs:

* A user client URL
* A supporter client URL

These URLs are important for the following configurations and settings.

## AnyDesk Group Settings for User Client

Use a [JSON policy](../../packages/json-backgrounder.md) to configure AnyDesk in the RealmJoin [Group Settings](../../rj-portal/groups-and-group-settings.md#group-settings). There are three different policies to configure AnyDesk.

The following JSON contains all configurations:

**Key** = Integration  
**Value** = {"AnyDesk: { "Enabled": true, "BootstrapperUrl": "[https://.../.../AnyDesk.exe](https://.../.../AnyDesk.exe)", "Ui": {TrayMenuTextEnglish": "Start remote session} } }

{% hint style="info" %}
The BootstrapperUrl is your **user client URL**.
{% endhint %}

It is also possible to split this single JSON from above, in three different JSON policies:

**Key** = Integration.AnyDesk.Enabled  
**Value** = true

and

**Key** = Integration.AnyDesk.BootstrapperUrl  
**Value** = "[https://.../.../AnyDesk.exe](https://.../.../AnyDesk.exe)"

and

**Key** = Integration.AnyDesk.UI.TrayMenuTextEnglish  
**Value** = "Start remote session"

The following JSON is possible as well:

**Key** = Integration.AnyDesk  
**Value** = {"Enabled":true, BootstrapperUrl": "[https://.../.../AnyDesk.exe](https://.../.../AnyDesk.exe)", "UI":{"TrayMenuTextEnglish": "Start remote session"} }

## Back-End Integration

After you configure your user client, AnyDesk will send you an email. This email contains your **Contract ID**, your **License ID** and your **API Password**. Send these IDs and the password to the [Gl端ck & Kanja suppor](mailto:support@glueckkanja.com)t. If you do so, GK will integrate a AnyDesk API in your RealmJoin portal.

### AnyDesk Supporter Client Setup Launcher

To allow a supporter to connect to a desktop, you have to assign the **AnyDesk Supporter Client Setup Launcher** to a supporter.
