Next, you need to specify when the notification should be published and when it should no longer be displayed. There are three values available for this configuration:

* Time offset

### Target and Ignore

Then you can select which groups should receive your notification \(Target\) and which groups should not receive it \(Ignore\).

To choose a target, click **Select groups** under **Target**. A search box appears where you can search for groups.
