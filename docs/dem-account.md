# Multi-User Devices

Multi-User Devices allow an administrator to provision devices intended to be used by more than one user. A tool for Multi-User Devices is **Device Enrollment Manager** \(short DEM\).

DEM is an Intune permission that can be applied to an Azure Active Directory user account and lets the user enroll up to 1,000 devices. A DEM account is useful for scenarios where devices are enrolled and prepared before handing them out to the users of the devices.

## Licenses

Devices enrolled by DEM accounts need to be licensed. Therefore, each DEM account needs an Intune user or device license assigned.

Example:

* Enterprise Mobility + Security \(user license\) or
* A simple device license

## Preparations

Before you can start with a device enrollment you have to do some preparations.

### Create DEM User

Create a generic user account that is not assigned to a real person. Please make sure that this account never gets deleted. In that case, enrolled devices will not stay under management anymore. Assign a suitable Intune license as described before.

### Create User Group for DEM Accounts

A new user group is necessary that contains all DEM users. Ad one \(e.g. **CFG - All multi-user device accounts DEM**\) and assign the previously created user.

### Prepare Group

In **Intune** the following actions are necessary for that group:

* Assign compliance policies and device configurations \(that should apply for these devices\)
* Assign Intune distributed apps \(e. g. RealmJoin Installer\)
* Check if DEM group can enroll and register new devices in Tune/Azure AD \(e. g. enrollment restrictions and Azure AD Join\)

The following steps must be done in **RealmJoin**

* Add RealmJoin configuration policies to that group
* Add Software packages \(that should be installed when the device is set up by DEM account\)
* Let Gl√ºck & Kanja mark this group as **Primary Users** \(obtain Azure AD Object ID\)

## Device Setup

A new and clean device will be set up with the DEM user account created before:

Depending on configuration second factor authentication will be enforced:

Device enrollment and provisioning will start:

Prompt for Windows Hello setup appears \(depending on configuration\):

After that, RealmJoin will start and install the defined set of software for the DEM account:

When logging in via DEM account \(primary user\) the software should be installed:

## Secondary User Experience

Secondary users are now able to log in::

Software assigned and installed by DEM account should be available

Additional software can be installed by this secondary user \(see **Software Packages**\):
