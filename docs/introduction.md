The modern, mobile workplace feeds on the ability to be productive fast as well as independent from regional infrastructure. A centerpiece of the modern workplace is the usage of cloud based **software-as-a-service** (SaaS) solutions and clean provisioned devices, allowing the access to corporate data and software in a short time.  
With Windows 10 as central OS, Azure AD for identity management and Microsoft Intune MDM service to manage all user devices, Microsoft offers a nearly complete package for an efficient work environment.  
However, Microsoft Intune lacks the ability to manage **classic Win32** applications.

RealmJoin is developed as a **Companion to Intune**, solving the **classic Win32 software gap** when using Microsoft Intune in corporate and enterprise environments, and providing a broad range of additional feature to elevate the management and general working experience.
