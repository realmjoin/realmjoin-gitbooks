# JSON - Short Overview

JavaScript Object Notation (short JSON) is a format for storing and transporting data. JSON is often used to send data from a server to a web page.

## Syntax and Structure

A JSON object is based on a key (name) and a value, that is typically rendered in curly brackets.

**Key**: A key is always a string enclosed in quotation marks.\
**Value**: A value can be a string, number, boolean expression, array or object

A pair of a key and a value is an object. An object is surrounded by curly brackets (**{}**). You can separate information (in an object) by ":" and "," .

* ":" = Separates name from value
* "," = Separates name-value pairs

## JSON examples

The following example is about a configuration of AnyDesk:

```
{
"Integration": {
    "AnyDesk": {
        "Enabled": true,
        "BootstrapperUrl" "https://.../.../AnyDesk.exe",
        "Ui":{"TrayMenuEnglish": "Start remote session"

            }
        }
    }
}
```

### All-in-one

In RealmJoin Group Settings, the JSON from above looks like this:

**Key** = Integration\
**Value** = {"AnyDesk: { "Enabled": true, "BootstrapperUrl": "https://../.../AnyDesk.exe", "Ui": {TrayMenuTextEnglish": "Start remote session} } }

### Split the All-in-one JSON

It is also possible to enable AnyDesk with the following JSON:

**Key** = Integration.AnyDesk.Enabled\
**Value** = true

You just add AnyDesk and Enabled to the key, separated by dots.

Similar to this you can add BootstrapperUrl and TrayMenuTextEnglish as well:

**Key** = Integration.AnyDesk.BootstrapperUrl\
**Value** = "https://../.../AnyDesk.exe"

and

**Key** = Integration.AnyDesk.UI.TrayMenuTextEnglish\
**Value** = "Start remote session"

These three single JSON settings are equal to the JSON from **All in one**. Combine all of them and you will get the same result from **All in one**

### Combination

If you want neither the all in one JSON nor the three single JSON settings you can use a combination of all of them:

**Key** = Integration.AnyDesk\
**Value** = {"Enabled":true, "BootstrapperUrl": "https://../.../AnyDesk.exe", "UI":{"TrayMenuTextEnglish": "Start remote session"} }

## JSON Arrays

A JSON array represents a list of values. An array is rendered by square brackets ( **\[]**). An array contains multiple values. The values in an array must be separated by commas.

The following example shows the RealmJoin tray menu, specially the **WebLinks** section:

**Key** = WebLinks\
**Value** =\
\[\
{\
"Name": "Google",\
"Target": "[https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com)",\
"Platform": "any"\
},\
{\
"Name": "Azure",\
"Target": "[https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)",\
"Platform": "any"\
}\
]

As as result of these JSON you get a **WebLinks** list which contains two links. Google and Microsoft Azure.
