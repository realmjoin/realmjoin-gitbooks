# Request Package

![](<../.gitbook/assets/rj-ac-uploadicon (1).png>)

If an application is not listed in the [App Store](app-store.md) or is in need of customization, a packaging request can be sent to Glück & Kanja.

For a package request you have to enter the package name, the version number and the intended users. There is also a comment field available for further notes.

Please provide the necessary binaries as well as all installation requirements and additional information. It is essential for in-time processing, that the request only contains the necessary binaries and a detailed installation guide.

After submitting the request information (please do not forget a contact email address if the requesting admin account does not have a monitored inbox. The requester is the first point of contact for any questions.), you will be able to upload your zip file containing the binaries. After the upload, a ticket will automatically be created and the packaging request will be handled by the Glück & Kanja staff.

When you have entered everything you need, click on **Send Request**. You can attach files to the request as soon as the request has been sent.

{% hint style="info" %}
To prevent spam and unsolicited requests, if no file is attached, the request is not processed. In case of a file-less request, a dummy.txt file has to be attached.
{% endhint %}

Once the package is created, it will appear in the App Store. In the App Store, you have to subscribe to the package. Click [here](app-store.md#app-subscribtion) to read how to subscribe to a package.
