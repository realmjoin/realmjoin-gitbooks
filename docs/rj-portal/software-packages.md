# Software Packages

![](<../.gitbook/assets/rj-ac-packagesicon (1).png>)

This menu contains a list of all added software packages. Nine different attributes are displayed in this menu:

* Package **Type**
* Package **Name**
* Package **GroupName**
* **Upgradeability** of a package
* Package **Version**
* Package **Order**
* Dependencies \*\*\*\*(\*\*Dep\*\*) for a package
* Group (**Gr**) assignment
* User (**Us**) assignment

![](<../.gitbook/assets/softwarepackages\_overview (1).png>)

Above the attributes, there is a search bar (**Search for ...**). This search compares the input made with each of the attributes and returns suitable results.

Next to the search box is the **Only Updates** checkbox. If you check this box, only the packages for which an update is available will be displayed. Next to it is another selection field: **Hide Organics**. If you check this box, all packages of type "Organic" will not be listed in the overview.

At the lower right end of the menu, you can browse through the pages manually.

## Package Assignment

If you click on a number in the **Gr** or **Us** fields, you will get a list of all RealmJoin groups and all RealmJoin users. In these lists, you can choose which groups or users should receive the software package.

### Assign a Group / User

| **Availability**          | <ul><li><strong>Allow Reinstall</strong>: This option allows the client user to reinstall and therefore override their current installation of the package.<br></li><li><strong>Allow Background Install</strong>: The software package may be installed outside of the black screen installation, thus not blocking the access to the client's desktop and software.<br><strong>Do not use this option for regular packages without discussion with your RealmJoin consultant!</strong><br></li><li><p><strong>Pre-Release:</strong> The pre-release flag has two distinctive features within RealmJoin. It allows:</p><p>1. To add a package with ID and version similar to another existing package in the portal and</p><p>2. If assigned to a group or user, it overwrites all other packages with the same ID assigned to the group user.<br><br>Those features are usually used for the testing of new packages or updates of an existing one: The test-groups or test-users get the pre-release version of a package assigned during the testing.<br><br>The pre-release flagged package is visually highlighted in the portal's package list with a lightning symbol behind the name.<br></p></li><li><strong>Require Intune Compliance</strong>: The package is installed as soon as RealmJoin is able to verify via the GraphAPI that the machine is considered compliant. This might stop the rollout for some time.

{% hint style="info" %}
Under normal circumstances, it is highly advised to prevent a normal user from having the same package assigned more than once.

To change the package Name or ID is not a proper way to edit assigned packages. Add a new package instead. Delete the obsolete one.

Do not use the dependency and order option on mandatory packages parallel. This might prevent the back-end from correctly resolve the order installation: During the initial rollout, or any rollout of mandatory packages after a login for this purpose, RealmJoin in the first step resolves all dependencies of the packages. If there are any, all packages which are listed as a dependency for a different package are installed. In the second step, the original packages are installed. This may cancel out any order numbers.

**For example:**

* Package A, order 1
* Package B, order 101and depending on Package C, order 100.
* If all packages are assigned as mandatory, the installation sequency will be C, A, B

**NOTE**: Per defintion, packages that are entered as dependency for other packages always have to be set to _Autoupgrade:true_.

| **Includes User Script**              | In the latest generation of packages, it is not necessary anymore to create a second package for the deployment of corresponding user settings, but such a script can be part of the main package. If this is the case, it will be run automatically if this option is checked. Parameters can be transferred via arguments as established. User scripts will not run for secondary users if the main application is not installed.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Main Script Restrictions - Users**  | This option allows a RealmJoin administrator to define whether this package should run for just the primary device user (default) or also/exclusively for secondary users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Main Script Restrictions - Phases** | <p>This option allows a RealmJoin administrator to define whether this package should be run during the initial deployment of the device or throughout other phases.</p><p>RealmJoin offers the following phases:</p><p><strong>Logon</strong>: The package runs after the user has logged on.</p><p><strong>Manual</strong>: The package will run, when the user starts it via tray menu.</p><p><strong>Initial</strong>: The package only runs during the deployment.</p><p><strong>Normal</strong>: Neither Logon, nor Manual, nor Initial. A background deployment.</p> |

The lower the number the higher the importance, therefore, a 10 will be installed before 100.<br><br>It has to be noted that a 0 is translated to no sequence given and the order number is only taken into account at the first rollout.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Availability**    | <ul><li><strong>Allow Reinstall</strong>: This option allows the client user to reinstall and therefore override their current installation of the package.<br></li><li><strong>Allow Background Install</strong>: The software package may be installed outside of the black screen installation, thus not blocking the access to the client's desktop and software.<br></li><li><p><strong>Pre-Release:</strong> The pre-release flag has two distinctive features within RealmJoin. It allows:</p><ol><li>To add a package with ID and version similar to another existing package in the portal and</li></ol><p>2. If assigned to a group or user, overwrites all other packages with the same ID assigned to the group user.<br><br>Those features are usually used for the testing of new packages or updates of an existing one: The test-groups or test-users get the pre-release version of a package assigned during the testing.<br><br>The pre-release flagged package is visually highlighted in the portal's package list with a lightning symbol behind the name.<br></p></li><li><strong>Require Intune Compliance</strong>: The package is installed as soon as RealmJoin is able to verify via the GraphAPI that the machine is considered compliant. This might stop the rollout for some time.

{% hint style="info" %}
Under normal circumstances, it is highly advised to prevent a normal user for having the same package assigned more than once.

To change package Name or ID is not a proper way to edit assigned packages. Add a new package instead. Delete the obsolete one.

Do not use the dependency and order option on mandatory packages parallel. This might prevent the back-end from correctly resolve the order installation: During the initial rollout, or any rollout of mandatory packages after a login for this purpose, RealmJoin in the first step resolves all dependencies of the packages. If there are any, all packages which are listed as a dependency for a different package are installed. In the second step, the original packages are installed. This may cancel out any order numbers.

**For example:**

* Package A, order 1
* Package B, order 101 and depending on Package C, order 100.
* If all packages are assigned as mandatory, the installation sequence will be C, A, B

| **Includes User Script**              | In the latest generation of packages, it is not necessary anymore to create a second package for the deployment of corresponding user settings, but such a script can be part of the main package. If this is the case, it will be run automatically if this option is checked. Parameters can be transferred via arguments as established. User scripts will not run for secondary users if the main application is not installed.                                                                                                                                          |
| **Main Script Restrictions - Users**  | This option allows a RealmJoin administrator to define whether this package should run for just the primary device user (default) or also/exclusively for secondary users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Main Script Restrictions - Phases** | <p>This options allows a RealmJoin administrator to define whether this package should be run during the initial deployment of the device or throughout other phases.</p><p>RealmJoin offers the following phases:</p><p><strong>Logon</strong>: The package runs after the user has logged on.</p><p><strong>Manual</strong>: The package will run, when the user starts it via tray menu.</p><p><strong>Initial</strong>: The package only runs during the deployment.</p><p><strong>Normal</strong>: Neither Logon, nor Manual, nor Initial.

### Deployed on Active Client

This tile shows a list of active clients to which the package has already been distributed.

### Paste JSON here

Instead of entering the name, version, order, args etc. manually, you can insert the JSON code of the package. You can find this code in the corresponding package repository.

### Technical Help

In this tile, you will find technical help and information if you need further support.

### Settings

## Add a Software Package

To add a Choco or Craft package, in the Software Packages overview, click one of the two green buttons in the upper right corner: +Add Choco or +Add Craft

You get an input mask (like the one from Package Definition, but it is empty).

## Duplicate a Package

Whenever a package with identical content is needed multiple times for the same user or group, the RealmJoin Portal offers the possibility to use the same package multiple times while preventing conflicting installations.

**A possible scenario:** One user group needs the same package with different arguments (for example to map several network drives) and the RealmJoin Client requires unique packages IDs.

To make the ID unique, a hash is written behind the ID and provided with a meaningful word/index, like **package-id#Value**
