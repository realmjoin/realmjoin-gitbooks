# Troubleshooting

## Possible reasons why a software package might not install

**1. The software package is not properly assigned to the user**

* In Azure AD: Is there a software distribution group for this software and is the user member of this group?
* In RealmJoin Admin Portal: Is there a package for this software and is this package assigned to the correct Azure AD group?
* Is the software package assigned for automatic (mandatory) or manual install?

**2. The software is assigned but the assignment is not received by the client**

* Is RealmJoin running?
* Is the RealmJoin configuration up to date?
* Is the RealmJoin version up to date?
* Are there any errors in the RealmJoin logs?

**3. The assignment reaches the client but the installation is not started or fails**

* Is the software assigned for manual installation?
* Is it possible to start the installation manually and are there any errors shown?
* Check RealmJoin logs and software installation logs if available?

## Verify Group Membership in Office 365 Admin Center

You need to know the software Distribution Group to which the software should be deployed.

Open Office 365 Admin Center Group management at: [Office 365 Admin Center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/groups)

[![O365 Portal](<.gitbook/assets/o365-portal-one (1).png>)](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-gitbooks/tree/3c2250fcc0d712e1b40ac535a1766b57ce01910c/docs/media/o365-portal-one.png)

Select appropriate software distribution group and verify if the user is member of this group.

## Review installed & available software

Find the RealmJoin icon in your taskbar.

[![Tray](<.gitbook/assets/rj-tray (1).png>)](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-gitbooks/tree/3c2250fcc0d712e1b40ac535a1766b57ce01910c/docs/media/rj-tray.png)

Click the RealmJoin icon and click **Software Packages**. Check if the software is listed and which status is displayed. Grayed-out indicated software is already installed. 'Black Text' (ready to install) indicates software is not installed. In this case, the installation failed or the software package is configured for manual installation.

[![Tray-Menu](<.gitbook/assets/rj-tray-menu (2).png>)](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-gitbooks/tree/3c2250fcc0d712e1b40ac535a1766b57ce01910c/docs/media/rj-tray-menu.png)

Click the software if it is shown as ready to install. This should start the software installation. Click **Show Details**

[![Install-Citrix](<.gitbook/assets/rj-install-citrix (1).png>)](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-gitbooks/tree/3c2250fcc0d712e1b40ac535a1766b57ce01910c/docs/media/rj-install-citrix.png)

If the installation fails, collect **complete** RealmJoin logfiles (see below) and attach to the incident ticket. Incident tickets to glueckkanja-gab without full logging will be closed. 

## RealmJoin Log Files

### Logging

#### Windows Event Logs
RealmJoin records all event data into log files. Those can easily be accessed on the client device using the Windows Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc). RealmJoin logs can be found under **Event Viewer (Local) / Windows Logs / Application**.

#### RealmJoin Logfiles

To troubleshoot package execution problems or RealmJoin Problems there are several Log Files available:

System Context Installations and other system tasks: `C:\Windows\Logs\realmjoin.log`

**NOTE:**  
For all support related incidents, please **exclusively** add the complete zip containing all relevant logfiles only. Do **NOT** attach just a part of the logfiles as mentioned above. The logs can be automatically collected and save to the current users desktop via the debug window (see the section below) or collected via the RealmJoin portal.  
Windows event logs may be added additionally be when opening a ticket.

## Debug Mode

To open the tray debug (and enter the debug mode) click **STRG + SHIFT + Click on the RealmJoin Icon**. The Client menu will open but with a further entry at the end of the menu: **Show Debug Window**.

Client menu:

[![RJclientmenu2](<.gitbook/assets/rj-ui4 (1).png>)](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-gitbooks/tree/3c2250fcc0d712e1b40ac535a1766b57ce01910c/docs/media/rj-ui4.png)

[![Advanced](<.gitbook/assets/rjx-debug-menu-four (1).png>)](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-gitbooks/tree/3c2250fcc0d712e1b40ac535a1766b57ce01910c/docs/media/rjx-debug-menu-four.png)

If a new user configuration is available, you can update the configuration.

[![Advanced](<.gitbook/assets/rjx-debug-menu-five (1).png>)](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-gitbooks/tree/3c2250fcc0d712e1b40ac535a1766b57ce01910c/docs/media/rjx-debug-menu-five.png)

You can reset the user configuration. After this is done, it is required to update the user configuration with **Check Config**

[![Advanced](<.gitbook/assets/rjx-debug-menu-six (1).png>)](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-gitbooks/tree/3c2250fcc0d712e1b40ac535a1766b57ce01910c/docs/media/rjx-debug-menu-six.png)

You can collect the RealmJoin log files automatically.

[![Advanced](<.gitbook/assets/rjx-debug-menu-seven (1).png>)](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-gitbooks/tree/3c2250fcc0d712e1b40ac535a1766b57ce01910c/docs/media/rjx-debug-menu-seven.png)

### Additional Functions of the Debug Mode

* It is possible to reinstall packages: during the **Debug Mode** all packages assigned to the user are visible and can be restarted.
* Package version numbers are displayed: for all assigned packages the available versions can be seen and checked against the desired state.

### Mandatory Software

If the Debug Mode is activated, mandatory software is marked with **\***.

## Token Error

There are several possible approaches to repair token errors.

### Delete Token.dat

To trigger a new token request, delete the file\
`C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\RealmJoin\token.dat`\
and restart your device. Newer RealmJoin (starting with v4.10) versions that detect broken tokens may repair them automatically.

### Reconnect to Domain

In the RealmJoin tray, you might use the **Reconnect to Domain** or **Change Domain Password** options to reinstate the connection authentication.

## RealmJoin Back-end

Replaced with Admin Console!

Go to RealmJoin back-end admin portal at: [RealmJoin back-end Portal](https://realmjoin-backend.azurewebsites.net)

[![RealmJoin Portal](<.gitbook/assets/rjserver-one (1).png>)](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-gitbooks/tree/3c2250fcc0d712e1b40ac535a1766b57ce01910c/docs/media/rjserver-one.png)

In **Software** select the required software package. At the right users and groups are visible which have been assigned to this software package. In this example, it has not been assigned to any individual user but to 2 groups. Assignments for automatic installation are shown in bold letters.

[![RealmJoin Portal](<.gitbook/assets/rjserver-two (1).png>)](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-gitbooks/tree/3c2250fcc0d712e1b40ac535a1766b57ce01910c/docs/media/rjserver-two.png)

## Corrupted Chocolatey installation

If the installation of software packages produce error messages hinting to a corrupt Chocolatey installation, it is possible to reinforce the automatic Chocolatey installation through RealmJoin.\
To do so, remove the _%chocolatey%_ environment variable and enforce a reboot of the client machine and the RealmJoin agent. This will trigger a reinstallation of Chocolatey.

## How can I remove the RealmJoin application from a client?

It is not supported to remove the RealmJoin application from a client.\
However, for test scenarios, there are two ways to remove the application from a client.

1. Reimage the client.
2. Delete manually.

Manual deletion instruction:

* Stop all running RealmJoin processes
* Remove the service, execute "sc delete realmjoin"
* Remove the executables from C:\Program Files\RealmJoin
* Delete registry hive HKLM and HKCU\SOFTWARE\RealmJoin
* Delete folder %LocalAppData%\RealmJoin
* Delete folder C:\ProgramData\RealmJoin
* Uninstalling Chocolatey ([https://chocolatey.org/docs/uninstallation](https://chocolatey.org/docs/uninstallation))

## Where does RealmJoin file the package scripts on the client?

You may find the data as follows:

* Chocolatey install scripts: %PROGRAMDATA%\chocolatey\lib\tools\chocolateyInstall.ps1
* Chocolatey blobs: Windows\Temp\chocolatey\\
* Craft scripts are cleaned up after the execution

## How can I send feedback to the RealmJoin team?
